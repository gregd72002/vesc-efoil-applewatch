This is a usable Apple Watch app built in Xcode. After compiling and sending it to Apple Watch, it will connect to VESC via Bluetooth LE and display current statistics.

The code is a bit of a mess, but it works.

The premise for the app for me was check live stats for my self build foil assist. 

Tested with VESC 6.3.

Some of the classes are fully converted from vesc-tool. Meaning, it is an easy lift to add further VESC functionality. Long live GROK AI as without it, the project would never be accomplished.
